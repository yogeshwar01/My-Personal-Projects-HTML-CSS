    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
      centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
      father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
      housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and
      the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
      family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and
      large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of
      its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found
      in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had
      involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
      pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's
      meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and
      the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.[19][20][21]

      In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a
      strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.[21] After completing his education
      at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College,
      Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] He
      moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was
      working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke
      his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the
      Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".[23] He
      narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight
      positions were available in the IAF.[24]</p>
